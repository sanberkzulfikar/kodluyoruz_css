        Early Life
        Musk was born to a South African father and a Canadian mother. He displayed an early talent for computers and
        entrepreneurship. At age 12 he created a video game and sold it to a computer magazine. In 1988, after obtaining
        a Canadian passport, Musk left South Africa because he was unwilling to support apartheid through compulsory
        military service and because he sought the greater economic opportunities available in the United States.

        PayPal And SpaceX
        Musk attended Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, and in 1992 he transferred to the University of
        Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, where he received bachelor’s degrees in physics and economics in 1995. He enrolled
        in graduate school in physics at Stanford University in California, but he left after only two days because he
        felt that the Internet had much more potential to change society than work in physics. That year he founded
        Zip2, a company that provided maps and business directories to online newspapers. In 1999 Zip2 was bought by the
        computer manufacturer Compaq for $307 million, and Musk then founded an online financial services company,
        X.com, which later became PayPal, which specialized in transferring money online. The online auction eBay bought
        PayPal in 2002 for $1.5 billion.

        Musk was long convinced that for life to survive, humanity has to become a multiplanet species. However, he was
        dissatisfied with the great expense of rocket launchers. In 2002 he founded Space Exploration Technologies
        (SpaceX) to make more affordable rockets. Its first two rockets were the Falcon 1 (first launched in 2006) and
        the larger Falcon 9 (first launched in 2010), which were designed to cost much less than competing rockets. A
        third rocket, the Falcon Heavy (first launched in 2018), was designed to carry 117,000 pounds (53,000 kg) to
        orbit, nearly twice as much as its largest competitor, the Boeing Company’s Delta IV Heavy, for one-third the
        cost. SpaceX also developed the Dragon spacecraft, which carries supplies to the International Space Station and
        is designed to carry as many as seven astronauts. Musk sought to reduce the expense of spaceflight by developing
        a fully reusable rocket that could lift off and return to the pad it launched from. Beginning in 2012, SpaceX’s
        Grasshopper rocket made several short flights to test such technology. In addition to being CEO of SpaceX, Musk
        was also chief designer in building the Falcon rockets, Dragon, and Grasshopper.
